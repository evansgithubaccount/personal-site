      Once upon a time you dressed so fine<br>
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn’t you?<br>People’d call, say, “Beware doll, you’re bound to fall”<br>
You thought they were all kiddin’ you<br>You used to laugh about<br>Everybody that was hangin’ out<br>
Now you don’t talk so loud<br>Now you don’t seem so proud<br>
About having to be scrounging for your next meal<br><br>How does it feel<br>
How does it feel<br>To be without a home<br>Like a complete unknown<br>Like a rolling stone?<br><br>
You’ve gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely<br>But you know you only used to get juiced in it<br>
And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street<br>And now you find out you’re gonna have to get used to it<br>
You said you’d never compromise<br>With the mystery tramp, but now you realize<br>
He’s not selling any alibis<br>As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes<br>
And ask him do you want to make a deal?<br><br>How does it feel<br>How does it feel<br>
To be on your own<br>With no direction home<br>Like a complete unknown<br>
Like a rolling stone?<br><br>You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns<br>
When they all come down and did tricks for you<br>You never understood that it ain’t no good<br>
You shouldn’t let other people get your kicks for you<br>You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat<br>
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat<br>Ain’t it hard when you discover that<br>
He really wasn’t where it’s at<br>After he took from you everything he could steal<br><br>
How does it feel<br>How does it feel<br>To be on your own<br>With no direction home<br>
Like a complete unknown<br>Like a rolling stone?<br><br>Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people<br>
They’re drinkin’, thinkin’ that they got it made<br>Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things<br>
But you’d better lift your diamond ring, you’d better pawn it babe<br>You used to be so amused<br>
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used<br>Go to him now, he calls you, you can’t refuse<br>
When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose<br>You’re invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal<br><br>
How does it feel<br>How does it feel<br>To be on your own<br>With no direction home<br>
Like a complete unknown<br>Like a rolling stone?

      Please allow me to introduce myself<br>I'm a man of wealth and taste<br>
I've been around for a long, long year<br>Stole many a man's soul and faith<br><br>
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ<br>Had his moment of doubt and pain<br>
Made damn sure that Pilate<br>Washed his hands and sealed his fate<br><br>
Pleased to meet you<br>Hope you guess my name<br>
But what's puzzling you<br>Is the nature of my game<br><br>
I stuck around St. Petersburg<br>When I saw it was a time for a change<br>
Killed the Tsar and his ministers<br>Anastasia screamed in vain<br><br>
I rode a tank<br>Held a general's rank<br>When the blitzkrieg raged<br>
And the bodies stank<br><br>Pleased to meet you<br>Hope you guess my name, oh yeah<br>
Ah, what's puzzling you<br>Is the nature of my game, oh yeah<br><br>
I watched with glee<br>While your kings and queens<br>Fought for ten decades<br>
For the gods they made<br><br>I shouted out,<br>"Who killed the Kennedys?"<br>
When after all<br>It was you and me<br><br>Let me please introduce myself<br>
I'm a man of wealth and taste<br>And I laid traps for troubadours<br>Who get killed before they reached Bombay<br><br>
Pleased to meet you<br>Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah<br>But what's puzzling you<br>
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby<br><br>Pleased to meet you<br>
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah<br>But what's confusing you<br>Is just the nature of my game<br><br>
Just as every cop is a criminal<br>And all the sinners saints<br>As heads is tails<br>
Just call me Lucifer<br><br>Cause I'm in need of some restraint<br>
So if you meet me<br>Have some courtesy<br>Have some sympathy, and some taste<br><br>
Use all your well-learned politesse<br>Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah<br>
Pleased to meet you<br>Hope you guessed my name, um yeah<br><br>
But what's puzzling you<br>Is the nature of my game, um mean it, get down<br>
Woo, who<br>Oh yeah, get on down<br><br>
Oh yeah<br>Oh yeah!<br>Tell me baby, what's my name<br>Tell me honey, can ya guess my name<br><br>
Tell me baby, what's my name<br>I tell you one time, you're to blame<br>Ooo, who<br>
Ooo, who<br><br>Ooo, who<br>Ooo, who, who<br>Ooo, who, who<br>Ooo, who, who<br><br>
Ooo, who, who<br>Oh, yeah<br>What's my name<br>

Sittin' in the morning sun<br>I'll be sittin' when the evening comes<br>
Watching the ships roll in<br>Then I watch them roll away again, yeah<br><br>
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay<br>Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh<br>
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay<br>Wastin' time<br><br>
I left my home in Georgia<br>Headed for the Frisco Bay<br>
Cuz I've had nothing to live for<br>And look like nothing's gonna come my way<br><br>
So, I'm just gon' sit on the dock of the bay<br>Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh<br>
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay<br>Wastin' time<br><br>Looks like nothing's gonna change<br>
Everything still remains the same<br>I can't do what ten people tell me to do<br>
So I guess I'll remain the same, listen<br><br>Sittin' here resting my bones<br>
And this loneliness won't leave me alone, listen<br>Two thousand miles I roam<br>
Just to make this dock my home, now<br><br>I'm just gon' sit at the dock of a bay<br>
Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh<br>Sittin' on the dock of the bay<br>
Wastin' time<br><br>[Whistling to fadeout]
