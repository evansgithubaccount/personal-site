            Can you picture this?<br><br>Dream if you can a courtyard<br>
            An ocean of violets in bloom<br>Animals strike curious poses<br>
            They feel the heat<br>The heat between me and you<br><br>
            How can you just leave me standing?<br>Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)<br>
            Maybe I'm just too demanding<br>Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold<br>
            Maybe you're just like my mother<br>She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)<br>
            Why do we scream at each other<br>This is what it sounds like<br>
            When doves cry<br><br>Touch if you will my stomach<br>
            Feel how it trembles inside<br>You've got the butterflies all tied up<br>
            Don't make me chase you<br>Even doves have pride<br><br>
            How can you just leave me standing?<br>Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold)<br>
