            Can you picture this?<br><br>Dream if you can a courtyard<br>

            Maybe you're just like my mother<br>She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)<br>
            Why do we scream at each other<br>This is what it sounds like<br>
            When doves cry<br><br>Touch if you will my stomach<br>
            Feel how it trembles inside<br>You've got the butterflies all tied up<br>
            Don't make me chase you<br>Even doves have pride<br><br>

                You got a fast car<br>I want a ticket to anywhere<br>Maybe we make a deal<br>
                Maybe together we can get somewhere<br>Any place is better<br>Starting from zero got nothing to lose<br>
                Maybe we'll make something<br>Me myself I got nothing to prove<br><br>
                You got a fast car<br>I got a plan to get us out of here<br>
                I been working at the convenience store<br>Managed to save just a little bit of money<br>
                Won't have to drive too far<br>Just 'cross the border and into the city<br>
                You and I can both get jobs<br>And finally see what it means to be living<br><br>
                See my old man's got a problem<br>He live with the bottle that's the way it is<br>
                He says his body's too old for working<br>His body's too young to look like his<br>
                My mama went off and left him<br>She wanted more from life than he could give<br>
                I said somebody's got to take care of him<br>So I quit school and that's what I did<br><br>
                You got a fast car<br>Is it fast enough so we can fly away?<br>
                We gotta make a decision<br>Leave tonight or live and die this way<br><br>
                So remember when we were driving driving in your car<br>Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk<br>
                City lights lay out before us<br>And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder<br>
                And I had a feeling that I belonged<br>I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone<br><br>
                You got a fast car<br>We go cruising, entertain ourselves<br>
                You still ain't got a job<br>And I work in a market as a checkout girl<br>
                I know things will get better<br>You'll find work and I'll get promoted<br>
                We'll move out of the shelter<br>Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs<br><br>
                So remember when we were driving driving in your car<br>Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk<br>
                City lights lay out before us<br>And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder<br>
                And I had a feeling that I belonged<br>I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone<br><br>
                You got a fast car<br>I got a job that pays all our bills<br>
                You stay out drinking late at the bar<br>See more of your friends than you do of your kids<br>
                I'd always hoped for better<br>Thought maybe together you and me would find it<br>
                I got no plans I ain't going nowhere<br>So take your fast car and keep on driving<br><br>
                So remember when we were driving driving in your car<br>Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk<br>
