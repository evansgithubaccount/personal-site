      Do you remember the<br />21st night of September?<br />Love was changing the minds of pretenders<br />
      While chasing the clouds away<br /><br />Our hearts were ringing<br />
      In the key that our souls were singing<br />As we danced in the night<br />
      Remember how the stars stole the night away<br /><br />Ba de ya - say do you remember<br />
      Ba de ya - dancing in September<br />Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day<br /><br />
      Ba duda, ba duda, ba duda, badu<br />Ba duda, badu, ba duda, badu<br />Ba duda, badu, ba duda<br /><br />My thoughts are with you<br />
      Holding hands with your heart to see you<br />Only blue talk and love<br />
      Remember how we knew love was here to stay<br /><br />Now December found the love we shared in September<br />
      Only blue talk and love<br />Remember the true love we share today<br /><br />
      Ba de ya - say do you remember<br />Ba de ya - dancing in September<br />Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day<br /><br />There was a<br />
      Ba de ya - say do you remember<br />Ba de ya - dancing in September<br />

      Is this the real life?<br />Is this just fantasy?<br />
      Caught in a landslide,<br />No escape from reality.<br /><br />
      Open your eyes,<br />Look up to the skies and see,<br />
      I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,<br />Because I'm easy come, easygo,<br />
      Little high, little low,<br />Any way the wind blows doesn't really matterto me, to me.<br /><br />
      Mama, just killed a man,<br />Put a gun against his head,<br />
      Pulled my trigger, now he's dead.<br />Mama, life had just begun,<br />
      But now I've gone and thrown it all away.<br /><br />Mama, ooh,<br />
      Didn't mean to make you cry,<br />If I'm not back again this timetomorrow,<br />
      Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.<br /><br />Too late, mytime has come,<br />
      Sends shivers down my spine,<br />Body's aching all the time.<br />
      Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,<br />Gotta leave you all behind andface the truth.<br /><br />
      Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows),<br />I don't wanna die,<br />
      I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.<br /><br />
      I see a little silhouetto of a man,<br />Scaramouche, Scaramouche, willyou do the Fandango?<br />
      Thunderbolt and lightning,<br />Very, very frightening me.<br />(Galileo) Galileo.<br />(Galileo) Galileo,<br />

      I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me.<br />He's just a poor boy from apoor family,<br />
      Spare him his life from this monstrosity.<br /><br />Easy come, easy go,will you let me go?<br />
      Bismillah! No, we will not let you go. (Let him go!)<br />Bismillah! Wewill not let you go. (Let him go!)<br />

      When I was young,<br />It seemed that life was so wonderful,<br />
      A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical.<br />And all the birds in the trees,<br />

      Logical, oh responsible, practical.<br />And then they showed me a world<br />
      Where I could be so dependable,<br />Oh clinical, oh intellectual, cynical.<br /><br />

      Won't you please,<br />Please tell me what we've learned<br />
      I know it sounds absurd<br />Please tell me who I am.<br /><br />
      I said now what would you say<br />Now we're calling you a radical,<br />
      A liberal, oh fanatical, criminal.<br /><br />Oh won't you sign up your name,<br />
      We'd like to feel you're acceptable,<br />Respectable, oh presentable, a vegetable!<br /><br />
      Take, take, take it<br /><br />But at night, when all the world's asleep,<br />

      Won't you tell me<br />Please tell me what we've learned<br />

      So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, <br />blue skies from pain.<br />
      Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?<br />A smile from a veil?<br />
      Do you think you can tell?<br /><br />Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?<br />
      Hot ashes for trees?<br />Hot air for a cool breeze?<br />
      Cold comfort for change?<br />Did you exchange<br />
      A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?<br /><br />How I wish, how I wish you were here.<br />
      We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,<br />Running over the same old ground.<br />
      What have we found?<br />The same old fears.<br />Wish you were here.
